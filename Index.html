        <p>Soccer can mean so many different things to so many different people. It could simply mean a game you enjoy, a place to escape, or just another sport. From a gameplay standpoint, soccer is a medium to express oneself. Every action, movement, and/or touch of the ball expresses who you are.The reason why people love watching soccer is because of the passion the sport makes them feel. ... Because of a lot of factors actually, but the most important one is because of the pride and affection fans and players feel for their soccer team.</p>
